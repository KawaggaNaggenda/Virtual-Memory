No,the tail-recursive filter function does not return elements in the same order as the original.

This is because in tail reursion is run in O(n) time space complexity in compiliation, which is always positive.

This is based on the fact that the function (lambda (x) (> x 0)), where x has to be greater that 0, thus reducing stack overflow.

Hence all the negative values are discared and only the positive ones remain i.e 25 44 56 88 19 27
